This project is inspired by [kubernetes/org](https://github.com/kubernetes/org)
repository.

It will contain "GitHub as code" to allow the community to ask for repositories,
teams and membership in a infrastructure as code way.

---

Right now it is the home for documentation around community processes and
organisations.

If you have any issue about the overall structure for Tinkerbell that is not
code or architecture oriented but related to how the community works feel free
to raise an issue here.
